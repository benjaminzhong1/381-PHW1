#### Queries

> These are 10 propositions and their solution queries done to familiarize myself with Structured Query Language. 
The topics covered in this chapter are the foundational SELECT, WHERE, FROM clauses and the essential data types found in SQL. There are date&time functions that are used and specified where clauses. String Operators, and aggregate functions are found in a few of the questions and there is an introduction to order and group bys. Case statements too. Partition bys.

#### Logistic Documents

> This section pertains to all the work tracking documents used to aid my learning. I **leveraged To-do Lists, Gannt Chart, and Scrum Boards** to organize and structure my workflow. Along with those files, you'll find individual markdown files pertaining to each separate chapter and topic. 

#### Recordings

> I find the best way to fully understand concepts are to write it down in my own words and to say it out loud, maybe to a rubber duck. These recordings help me reinforce my understandings and to formulate strong definitions and concepts. Recorded over a powerpoint deck.
